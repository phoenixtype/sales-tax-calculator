# sales-tax-calculator
This application calculates the sales tax and total cost of items in a shopping basket and prints out the receipt details. The basic sales tax rate is 10% on all goods, except for books, food, and medical products which are exempt. Additionally, there is a 5% import duty sales tax on all imported goods. The application should take the name and price of each item in the shopping basket as input and output a receipt that includes the name and price of each item, the total sales tax, and the total cost of the basket. The sales tax must be rounded up to the nearest 0.05 based on the tax rate. The application should be able to handle multiple shopping baskets and produce a separate receipt for each one. Finally, the application should be implemented using Java and include unit tests to ensure the correctness of the solution.
